To run the vision code:
------------------------
 
Run "runvision.sh"

    ./vision/runvision.sh -p(0|1)

where -p is 0 for the main pitch, or 1 for the other one. See vision.py --help for more options.
    
To switch between thresholding options for yellow/blue robots and the ball, press `y`, `b` and `r` respectively.
To toggle between the raw image or the channel currently being thresholded, press `t`.
